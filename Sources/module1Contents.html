However, these attacks aren't always obvious to those who have yet to encounter them. Ways of phishing include spoofed emails, fraudulent websites, and scanners where victims may not be as concerned to check it's legitimancy.<br /><br />
        
            &emsp;This module will contain a brief overview on phishing attacks and social engineering. Afterwards, we will look into examples of phishing emails and identify how we can prevent these attacks from occuring.
        At the end of this module, we will test your knowledge with a quiz!<br /><br />

        <h3>Real World Examples</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;With the growth of technological software in an age where techonology is part of a wide-spread knowledge base, these attacks still can occur. According to <a href="https://www.cyberark.com/resource/cyberark-global-advanced-threat-landscape-report-2018/" target="_blank" style="color: #009CDE;text-decoration: none">CyberArk Global Advanced Threat Landscape Report 2018</a>, 56 percent of IT security decision makers said that targeted phishing attacks were the top security threat they've faced. In <a href="https://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_DBIR_2018_Report_en_xg.pdf" target="_blank" target="_blank" style="color: #009CDE;text-decoration: none">Verizon's 2018 Breach Investigations report</a>, 92 percent of malware is still delivered by email.<br /><br />

            &emsp;There is an underlying similarity in the causes in both reports - human interactions with malicious software disguising itself as something harmless. Let's take a look at some examples of some potentionally harmful emails.<br /><br />
        </p>

    <div class="3">
        <h3>Spoofed Emails (Spear Phishing)</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp;A common way of phishing is through spoofed emails. These emails are deliberately set up to look official and of high priority to take action, some also disguising themselves of being part of a large corporation such as banks, online shopping accounts, and more. This practice is also considered as spear phishing.<br /><br />

            &emsp;Typically you'll find the email asking the user to provide more information for their account, provide a link that will redirect them onto a fraudulent website to fill out a form with sensative information, or mention high threats if an action they inquire is not fulfilled.<br /><br />

            &emsp;Depending on the situation in which companies will reach out to a user, always question the legitemancy of the incoming email and research when in doubt. Ideally, keep away from responding to emails placed in your spam folder as they are flagged to be emails of little to no importance unless otherwise specified from a specific company.<br /><br />

            &emsp;Emails vary of different formats - some being as simple as plain text written in a message to a complex format, mimicking a specific company with stolen logos to make it seem real. Let's look at some examples of what spoofed emails look like.<br /><br />
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="4">
        <h4>Email Example</h4>
        <p>
            &emsp;Let's analyze the following email.<br /><br />

            <img src="Images/module1/email1.png" style="width:900px; height:500px" border="1"><br /><br />
            &emsp;As we can see, there are a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes throughout this document, a single person sending highly sensative information, no information regarding what company this person is talking about (generic/unknown domain), and asking for personal information that can be used to identify/impersonate someone.<br /><br />

            Typically these emails are made to scare a user into thinking they are about to lose a lot of money out of their accounts and mentioning "power of attorney" to a complete stranger, in this case "CAMBELL WILLIE". <br /><br />

            Right off the bat, we should feel as if something is not adding up and either ignore or delete this email without a second thought of answering back. If, for some reason, this email included specific companies such as Bank of America or Regions Bank and you are a customer for them, be sure to get in contact with the company via their official website, phone number, or branch. Always be sure to validate any inquiries before sending sensative information to a stranger.<br /><br />
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="5">
            &emsp;Although the previous example was clearly malicious, not every malicious email seems as obvious.<br /><br />
            &emsp;<img src="Images/module1/email2.png" style="width:550px; height:600px" border="1"><br /><br />

            At first glance, this email looks pretty legit. The email appears to be carefully crafted to include Amazon's logo for prime and other copyrighted logos. However, there are some things that could indicate this is a spam email.<br /><br />

            Let's begin with the sender's address. It appears to be a phony address made with random letters and characters sent from an unclear domain. Another indicator would be the address below the unsubscribe link. If you were to search this address, you would find that the address is not affliated with Amazon at all as well as the Customer Support PO box. Ironically, the last line in this email talks about being "in full compliance with US Federal CAN-SPAM act 2003", which includes a number of compliances emails need to be presented as to not be considered "spam".<br /><br />
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="6">
        <h4>Fraudulent Websites (Pharming)</h4>
        <p>
            &emsp;Let's start by taking a look at the second email previously. This email provided a few links that the user can use to redirect them to specific websites. However, most likely these websites aren't hosted by the actual company's server but instead independantly owned by a group of people who strive to earn your trust and provide their details for their benefit. This practice of redirecting users to a bogus website is also known as pharming.<br /><br />

            &emsp;These websites are known to be fraudulent due to their nature of claiming to be part of an organization to hopefully entice a user and have them believe the weblinks provided are legit. In most cases, websites will ask for user logins to access their accounts or to provide some sort of action to be taken. This information will then be saved for the phisher's to exploit. If sensative information is given such as a social security number, bank accounts, and card numbers, phishers can use this information to gain access to the user's money as well as potentially stealing their identity.<br /><br />

            &emsp;A few good ways to avoid these websites starts with checking the integrity of the links provided in an email, navigate to a company website directly to investigate any high priority actions mentioned, and avoid providing any sort of sensative information.<br /><br />
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="7">
        <h4>Scanners (Skimmers and Shimmers)</h4>
        <p>
            &emsp;If you've come in contact with an ATM, gas pump, grocery checkout line, or any other machine that has a card reader, you may not have realized these could potentially been tampered with. Although this may affect those in a physical world versus online, scanners are still a very subtle phishing attack hidding away in daily life.<br /><br />

            &emsp;So what are scanners? They can be broken down into two parts. First are skimmers, they are malicious card readers attached to real payment terminals to harvest data from users swiping their cards. Skimmers are made to look like an extention to card readers that fits over an existing card reader. The skimmers are able to take in data via the magnetic strip.<br /><br />

            &emsp;Shimmers can also be used to handle chips. However, these are a lot harder to detect versus skimmers due to being inside of devices, away from the eye of the public. Shimmers can read data on your card via chip. Data collected can be used to clone a magnetic strip of a card.<br /><br />

            <img src="Images/module1/skimmer.png" style="width:400px; height:250px" border="1"><br /><br />

            &emsp;When using one of these devices that allow self-service point of sales, be sure to check for any tampering of these machines. This includes checking the top of the machine, near the speakers, card reader itself, and the keyboard. If something may look out of ordinary, avoid using that machine. Another method is to wiggle every component that you may be suspicious about. Check if the pieces pushed will move; this method will not work on shimmers or devices that capture and hold your card until your transaction is complete. Take precautions against shimmers by covering the keyboard whenever entering a PIN. Avoid doing transactions in secluded areas with low traffic as phishers may have the comfort of no one looking at their actions.<br /><br />

        <h4>Malware</h4>
        <p>
            &emsp;Malware are software developed to either harm a computing device or deriving benefits from it of its user. These programs can be divided into two categories: residing on users' machines to supply sensitive user information or hide pieces of software in users' computers or propagate first category of maleware for phishers. <br /><br />

            &emsp;First category include spyware (monitor the user), adware (download, display, or play advertising material), keyloggers (capture keystrokes), Rootkits (allows software that provide user information to operate in stealth mode for phishers), and Trojan horses (common in Rootkits). <br /><br />

            &emsp;Second category include worms and viruses in which are capable to replicate themselves to propagate from one computer to another. This can allow extractions of sensative user information and act as part of the "bot army" that sends phishing spam to internet users and actively compromise other machines.<br /><br />

            &emsp;Unfortunately, it is quite easy for malware to be downloaded onto one's machine. Some ways to prevent maleware begins with user education. Avoid running in high privliege administrator mode for daily activities, choosing strong passwords, run a set of services and applications that machines use, patch the services regularly as security vulnerabilities are detected, and download software only from trusted sites.<br /><br />
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="9">
        <h4>Physical Threats</h4>
        <p>
            &emsp;An easy conclusion could be made after reading the last few pages - just unplug your computer from any internet access and remove yourself off the grid. It would solve things entirely, right?<br /><br />

            &emsp;Although that may be a sound proof conclusion, it is unfortunately not going to stop all attacks from occuring. Not all harmful components come in the form of a software or digitally sent medium - you can experience phishing via something small and innocent such as a USB drive or even by social engineering.<br /><br />

            &emsp;USB drives are your portable storages that can be plugged into any computing device with an USB port. Phishers can infect USBs with a virus or Trojan that can allow access to logins, passwords, and information on the computer or the network the computer is connected to. These are deadly as they can spread across multiple machines as soon as possible.<br /><br />

            &emsp;Interestingly enough, social engineering can also be used for phishing. This can include pretending to be someone of authority or impersonating a representative for a company and persuade users into providing them information and recovering sensative documents in the garbage that may not have been shredded.<br /><br />
        </p>

    <div class="10">
        <h4>Preventing these Attacks</h4>
        <p>
            &emsp;We saw that phishing attacks can vary in different shapes and are very serious for specialists to fight against to protect users whether it be by providing some sort of antivirus software, embedding safeguards into an operating system to protect essential files/applications, or providing research of what may be lying on the web.<br /><br />

            &emsp;Is it safe to say every device we have is safe? Not in the slightest. Every computing device is at risk regardless of the operating system or device type. This includes computers, cell phones, and other stand-alone devices that may never be connected to the internet can be vulnerable.<br /><br />

            &emsp;For each type of attack, it is important to understand what the attack could be caused from and prevent any signs of actions that could put our devices and personal information at risk. While it may be easy to think nothing harmful will happen to us if we haven't been threatened, it is always good to take precaution in case we ever see the day where our information is exposed and our devices are compromised.<br /><br />
